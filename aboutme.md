My name is Nolan Townsend and I am interested in all things pertaining to Earth Sciences.  My current interest is how climate change will effect future water availiablility, especially in the southwestern United States.

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### Recent Experience

At present, I am working as an "assistant engineer" at Hazen and Sawyer, where I involved with analyzing water resources and water resources planning within the state of New Mexico, and beyond.   

I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.

I recently graduated from UNM where I aquired a Masters degree in Earth and Planetary Sciences.  My research involved exploring the climatology and hydrology of the Rio Grande basin south of the San Marcial (New Mexico) stream gauge.  I explored drought scenarios with respect to climate change and impacts on the streamflow in the Rio Grande. To accomplish this, I used bias corrected and downscaled climate ([CMIP5])(https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/data-portal.html) data from the U.S Bureau of Reclamation.  The climate model output is used in conjunction with a surface hydrology model to produce routed streamflow based on the climate model output.  The routed streamflow values are “normalized” to match the statistics of the observed baseline period (1964-2013).  This statistical parameterization is a simple and effective technique to produce realistic future inflow values without explicitly accounting for human impairments upstream of the San Marcial streamgage.  I used these future inflow values in conjunction with a water balance model to assess future water resources management options.
