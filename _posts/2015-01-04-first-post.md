# Why did I make this site?

The point of creating this website, and subsequent posts, is to give me motivation to enhance my programming knowledge and channel it to explore Earth Science data.  I became intersted in programming while working on my Master's thesis at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The journey by began with a course in MATLAB course with Earth Science applications.  From there, I applied that (still limited) knowledge to manipulate climate datasets I used for my research.  At present, the climate datasets I worked with are primarily in netCDF format; the easiest way to interact with these data types was through a programming language.  In essence, MATLAB was my gateway program, as it were, but I eventually had to make a decision regarding the program/programming language I wanted to use for my research and thesis figures.  After poking around online and asking about other peoples' experience, I settled on Python.  I ended up spending the summer learning basics (syntax, control flow, packages that fit my needs, etc.).  

I still consider myself a novice in programming overall, but after I saw what it was capable of I was hooked.  Just to reemphasize, I am not a programmer by trade, so I imagine a seasoned programmer will be able to poke holes in code to the point it resembles swiss cheese.  That said, my ultimate goal is to use this site as an excuse to get hands on experience with (self motivated) projects and continue imporving my code based on feedback from the community.  Also, I hope to motivate others, with limited experience to try, it out for themselves and see what they are capable of learning and creating in the process!
